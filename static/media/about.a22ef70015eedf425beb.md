Hi there ✌️ nice to meet you!

I'm an aspiring Full Stack Software Engineer with a passion for writing code and creating visually engaging experiences across all devices. I'm well acquainted with _Frontend_, _Backend_, _Database_, _DevOps_ and _Cloud Technologies_. I primarily code in **Java**, **Typescript** and **Dart** and I leverage GitLab CI/CD for streamlined workflows. My coding journey began by creating plugins and mods for Minecraft, sparking my passion for the creative possibilities programming offers.

When I’m not immersed in code, you’ll often find me exploring the latest cinematic releases, getting lost in a good book, or spending quality time hiking in nature. I'm also a fan of multiplayer horror games with friends – always a thrill!

Thanks for stopping by!

All the best!
